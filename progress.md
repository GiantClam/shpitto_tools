## Test Results
<!-- 
  WHAT: Table of tests you ran, what you expected, what actually happened.
  WHY: Documents verification of functionality. Helps catch regressions.
  WHEN: Update as you test features, especially during Phase 4 (Testing & Verification).
  EXAMPLE:
    | Add task | python todo.py add "Buy milk" | Task added | Task added successfully | ✓ |
    | List tasks | python todo.py list | Shows all tasks | Shows all tasks | ✓ |
-->
| Test | Input | Expected | Actual | Status |
|------|-------|----------|--------|--------|
|      |       |          |        |        |

## Error Log
<!-- 
  WHAT: Detailed log of every error encountered, with timestamps and resolution attempts.
  WHY: More detailed than task_plan.md's error table. Helps you learn from mistakes.
  WHEN: Add immediately when an error occurs, even if you fix it quickly.
  EXAMPLE:
    | 2026-01-15 10:35 | FileNotFoundError | 1 | Added file existence check |
    | 2026-01-15 10:37 | JSONDecodeError | 2 | Added empty file handling |
-->
<!-- Keep ALL errors - they help avoid repetition -->
| Timestamp | Error | Attempt | Resolution |
|-----------|-------|---------|------------|
| 2026-02-02 16:53 | session-catchup.py not found (CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT unset) | 1 | Used direct template paths under ~/.codex/skills |
| 2026-02-02 18:25 | session-catchup.py not found (CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT unset) | 2 | Proceeded without catchup script and logged result |
| 2026-02-02 17:20 | git status failed: not a git repository | 1 | Continued without git status |
| 2026-02-02 20:05 | OPENROUTER connection error during P2W regen | 1 | Retried generation; succeeded |

## 5-Question Reboot Check
<!-- 
  WHAT: Five questions that verify your context is solid. If you can answer these, you're on track.
  WHY: This is the "reboot test" - if you can answer all 5, you can resume work effectively.
  WHEN: Update periodically, especially when resuming after a break or context reset.
  
  THE 5 QUESTIONS:
  1. Where am I? → Current phase in task_plan.md
  2. Where am I going? → Remaining phases
  3. What's the goal? → Goal statement in task_plan.md
  4. What have I learned? → See findings.md
  5. What have I done? → See progress.md (this file)
-->
<!-- If you can answer these, context is solid -->
| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Where am I? | Phase 1 (P2W Quality Fixes) |
| Where am I going? | Phases 2-5 |
| What's the goal? | Fix P2W output issues and add generator safeguards |
| What have I learned? | See findings.md |
| What have I done? | See above |

*Update after completing each phase or encountering errors*

- 2026-02-04 11:13:24 Session-catchup failed: CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT unset; script path /scripts/session-catchup.py not found.
- 2026-02-04 11:14:08 Ran session-catchup script (no output; assuming no unsynced context reported).
- 2026-02-04 11:15:13 Read p2w_1770109698412 result.json: core-features layoutHint.align=left; specs layoutHint.align=left; trust logos use local filenames (award-*.svg); lifestyle scenes layoutHint.carousel; hero/CTA align center.
- 2026-02-04 11:16:08 Checked composition presets: F01/F02/S01 default align=start; G02 preset exists (carousel) but no required classes defined; suggests builder may not enforce actual carousel component.
- 2026-02-04 11:18:01 NavbarBlock uses inline gap with CSS var --space-4/--space-2; if variable undefined, nav links/CTAs collapse. Likely root cause of spacing issue.
- 2026-02-04 11:19:03 LeadCaptureCTABlock uses Button default size; no explicit size for CTA, so padding depends on Button default. Secondary variant only when cta.variant=secondary.
- 2026-02-04 11:19:48 ConsistencyGuardian checks spacing/color/layout prop validity only; no checks for carousel usage, heading alignment consistency, or image URL reachability.
- 2026-02-04 11:22:19 magic-exports has no Carousel; manifest building only lists what’s in magic/shadcn export maps. Need to add Carousel component to magic exports for G02.
- 2026-02-04 11:23:42 normalizeTrustLogosMarquee injects <img src={logo.url}>; if generated logos use image/src fields, this breaks. Also lifestyle scenes normalization forces grid layout, not carousel.
- 2026-02-04 11:24:19 normalizeLayoutHint maps align values to 'start'/'center'; composition presets applied in normalizePages. F01/F02/S01 defaults likely drive align=start.
- 2026-02-04 11:27:28 Layout validation skips align checks for list=cards/tiles/rows, so heading alignment inconsistencies aren’t flagged; needs stricter alignment check.
- 2026-02-04 11:30:00 Section generation retries on layout issues from collectLayoutIssues; enhancing those checks can enforce alignment/carousel rules.
- 2026-02-04 11:37:50 Hero blocks use Button without size and CTA gap via CSS vars; should switch to size=lg and fixed gap classes.
- 2026-02-04 11:38:59 LeadCaptureCTA and FeatureWithMedia blocks use CSS-var gaps and default button size; should switch to fixed gaps and size=lg for CTAs.
- 2026-02-04 11:40:21 Internal creation-client buttons use default size; pricing-cards uses default size Button full width. Consider size=sm for internal UI if default grows.
- 2026-02-04 11:41:31 Verified Carousel export/import added to magic-exports and runtime.
- 2026-02-04 11:42:15 Reviewed normalizeGeneratedComponentCode changes; carousel guard, design showcase grid/border, CTA size/secondary, comparison badge logic present.
- 2026-02-04 11:44:26 Found multiple uses of CSS var --space-* in blocks; need to confirm if variables defined or replace with Tailwind gaps to avoid collapse.
- 2026-02-04 11:46:09 Added --space-* CSS variables to sandbox theme CSS to prevent gap collapse when components use var(--space-*).
- 2026-02-04 17:37:49 Added SceneSwitcher component (Tabs/Carousel auto), wired into magic exports/runtime, and updated prompts + layout validator to enforce SceneSwitcher for G02.
- 2026-02-04 17:38:03 Added themeContract.layoutRules.sectionAlignOverrides and alignLocked flow; validator now enforces alignment only when locked.
- 2026-02-04 17:39:08 Updated technical solution doc with sectionAlignOverrides + SceneSwitcher architecture changes.
- 2026-02-04 17:43:16 Added SceneSwitcher to manifest so LLM sees it in available components list.
- 2026-02-04 18:00:26 Investigated p2w_1770198778476 failures: corevalue/usagescenarios failed layout with issue 'align start missing'. LayoutHint align center was overridden to start by composition preset when compositionPreset is set.

- 2026-02-04: Session-catchup script failed (CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT unset); proceeding without catchup.
- 2026-02-04: Investigated p2w_1770198778476; coreValue/usageScenarios layoutHint align=center with compositionPreset F01/G03; applyCompositionDefaults likely overriding align to preset start while alignLocked stays true, causing layout validator errors.
- 2026-02-04: Patched applyCompositionDefaults to preserve explicit align when alignLocked even with compositionPreset.
- 2026-02-04: Sanity-checked align resolution logic via node snippet; alignLocked=true preserves align=center even when preset align=start.
- 2026-02-04: Investigated p2w_1770201390942; design-showcase and scene-showcase failed layout, scene intent should map to G02 SceneSwitcher rather than upgraded G01; added composition preset class auto-injection and scene preset mapping tweak.
- 2026-02-04: Investigated p2w_1770213779892; immersive-gallery parse failed because LLM returned component as stringified object with backtick code. Added component coercion in normalizeSectionPayload to extract name/code from string and recover payload.
- 2026-02-04: Investigated p2w_1770215219340; design-showcase layout failed due to align start missing from alignLocked being set for any align. Updated normalizeLayoutHint to only lock when alignLocked flag present.
- 2026-02-04: Investigated p2w_1770216068018; builder parse failed due to empty/{} tool responses and malformed JSON. Added builder-level retries on empty outputs, strict JSON retry, and enforced tool output in repair prompt.
