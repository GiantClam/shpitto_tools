# Website Generation Workflow

## Scope

Use this workflow for complete website generation from requirements to final delivery, including planning, design system setup, section batching, visual polish, and validation.

## Style Library (Mandatory)

Support and prioritize the dynamic style library at:

`https://github.com/VoltAgent/awesome-design-md`

### Dynamic Loading Rules

1. Fetch the latest README and repository tree before each new website generation run. Do not rely only on manually copied static files.
2. Extract: `category / styleName / slug / description / DESIGN.md URL`.
3. Build a local style index (defined below) and use it as the basis for style selection.
4. If network access fails, fall back to the latest cached index and mark it as `stale-cache`.

### Required Local Index Structure

```text
.cache/awesome-design-md/
  index.json
  index.md
  categories/
    <category-slug>.md
  README.source.snapshot.md
```

`index.json` must include at least:

- `sourceRepo`
- `generatedAt`
- `totalStyles`
- `categories[]`
- `styles[]` (each item includes `name/slug/category/description/designMdUrl/previewUrl`)

### Traceable Style Selection Rules

1. Match style candidates (Top 3) using industry, audience, and conversion goals.
2. Provide fit rationale and risk notes for each candidate.
3. Output one recommended style and explicit exclusion reasons.
4. Save `style-selection-record` including index version, candidates, final choice, and reasons.

## Required Phases

### Phase 0: Requirement Enrichment

1. Extract user goals, industry, target audience, key value propositions, and page structure.
2. Identify missing critical information and complete it.
3. Produce a structured requirements summary.

Quality gate: Critical information complete OR confidence > 0.8.

### Phase 0.5: Style Library Load and Indexing

1. Dynamically load awesome-design-md.
2. Build or refresh the full local index.
3. Produce style candidates and a style selection record.

Quality gate: Index is available and style decision is traceable.

### Phase 1: Planning and Design System

1. Create or update planning files (`task_plan`, `findings`, `progress`).
2. Define design system tokens: color, typography, spacing, radius, shadow, container rules.
3. Validate implementation readiness and remove hardcoded style values.

Quality gate: Design system validation passes.

### Phase 1.5: Image and Icon Asset Preparation

#### Image Generation (use `web-image-generator` skill)

1. Analyze site structure and produce an image requirements list.
2. Classify each required image (Hero / Background / Illustration / Screenshot / Icon-like asset).
3. Generate optimized AI image prompts.
4. Run image generation tools or provide prompts for generation.
5. Save generated images under `images/`.

#### Icon Integration (use `web-icon-library` skill)

1. Select one primary icon library (Lucide is recommended).
2. Map icons to functional semantics and UI intent.
3. Enforce icon size and color via design-system tokens.
4. Add required accessibility attributes.

#### Outputs

- `images/image_prompts.md` (image prompt specification)
- `images/*.png` (generated images)
- Icon usage manifest (icon name, purpose, location)

Quality gate:

- Image requirement coverage is complete.
- Image style is consistent with the design system.
- Icon semantics are clear and accessible.

### Phase 1.6: Site-wide Bilingual Content (EN/ZH)

1. Define default and fallback language (default `en`, support `zh`).
2. Build a unified i18n key structure (page-level + section-level keys).
3. Add language switch in the top navigation (EN / ZH).
4. Ensure all core copy has bilingual mapping (nav, headings, CTA, form labels, footer).
5. Preserve the current route on language switch; only content language changes.
6. Persist language preference (recommended: `localStorage`).
7. Keep default-language content readable without JavaScript.

Outputs:

- `i18n/messages.en.json`
- `i18n/messages.zh.json`
- `i18n/README.md` (key naming and contribution flow)

Quality gate:

- Bilingual coverage of critical copy = 100%.
- Language switch causes no broken routes and no leaked placeholder keys.
- Language switch does not reduce accessibility (`lang`, `aria-label`, readable form labels).

### Phase 2: Section Batch Generation

1. Generate in batches of 3-5 sections.
2. Run design-system consistency checks immediately after each batch.
3. Record progress and design decisions.
4. Run visual QA every 3 sections.
5. For each section requiring a visual image, attempt image generation and placement:
   - If generation succeeds: replace the target placeholder with the generated image.
   - If generation fails: pass without blocking delivery, keep placeholder or style-only fallback.

Quality gate: Design-system compliance rate > 90%.

### Phase 3: Visual Refinement

1. Unify visual hierarchy and rhythm.
2. Add micro-interactions and lightweight motion.
3. Alternate backgrounds and visual cadence for pacing.

Quality gate: Visual consistency > 85%.

### Phase 4: Final Validation

1. Breakpoint checks (320 / 768 / 1440).
2. Accessibility checks (WCAG AA).
3. Link and interaction usability checks.
4. Core performance sanity checks.
5. Verify image placement policy:
   - Successfully generated images are correctly inserted and rendered.
   - Failed generation tasks are marked `passed` and treated as non-blocking.

Quality gate: All checks pass.

## Image Generation Integration

### Image Generation Utility

Use the shared `image_gen.py` utility:

```bash
python3 scripts/image_gen.py "your prompt" \
  --aspect_ratio 16:9 \
  --image_size 2K \
  --output project/images \
  --filename hero-main \
  --negative_prompt "text, watermark, low quality"
```

### Environment Configuration

```env
IMAGE_BACKEND=gemini  # or openai, qwen, zhipu, volcengine
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-api-key
GEMINI_MODEL=gemini-3.1-flash-image-preview
```

### Supported Backends

- Core: `gemini`, `openai`, `qwen`, `zhipu`, `volcengine`
- Extended: `stability`, `bfl`, `ideogram`
- Experimental: `siliconflow`, `fal`, `replicate`

### Image Types and Suggested Specs

| Type | Suggested Size | Aspect Ratio | Usage |
|------|----------------|--------------|-------|
| Hero Image | 2560x1440 | 16:9 | Above-the-fold visual |
| Section Background | 1920x1080 | 16:9 | Section background |
| Feature Illustration | 800x600 | 4:3 | Feature cards |
| Product Screenshot | 1440x900 | 16:10 | Product showcase |
| Icon/Logo | 512x512 | 1:1 | Symbol assets |
| Social Share | 1200x630 | 1.91:1 | Social sharing preview |

### Prompt Optimization Principles

1. Hero: prioritize visual impact and reserve safe text space.
2. Background: keep contrast low to avoid competing with content.
3. Illustration: keep style consistent, preferably flat and clean.
4. Screenshot-like visuals: preserve realism and clarity.
5. Icon-like visuals: keep simple, scalable, and limited palette.

- Using hardcoded color/spacing values
- Delivering without passing quality gates
- Missing image alt text or equivalent accessibility labeling
- Mixing multiple icon libraries with inconsistent style
